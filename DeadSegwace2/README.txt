   SYNOPSIS
--------------
You are an astronaut lost in deep space, who's ship was wrecked after crashing into some alien spacecraft. 
Also, as is often the case in such incidents, your crew was infected with some extraterrestrial virus and turned into flesh eating zombies. 
Luckily, you were able to excape the ship on a segway and found yourself on some kind of galactic race track. 
Knowing that you have only a few hours left until your oxygen is gone, you figured that you might as well spend your last moments
trying to beat your own highscore on the track.
